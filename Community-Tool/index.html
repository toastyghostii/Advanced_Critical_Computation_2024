    <h1>The "Am I Ace" Quiz</h1>

    <p>Sexual attraction and libido are not the same. While they can be linked, it's important to know that asexuals can still have sex drive, and that the asexuality spectrum is not just about desire or engagement. Someone can have a sexual history and still be asexual. Additionally, being asexual is not the same as being aromantic. Someone can be asexual while still feeling romantic attraction and getting crushes. Try to keep an open mind while taking this quiz. Some questions may ask about interest since that's an easier feeling to understand than attraction itself. The questions are more for you to reflect on yourself and how you feel than they are to determine for you whether you might be on the spectrum or not.

    <h3>This might feel like a pointless question, since it's what you came here to figure out, but it's actually the only one that really matters in determining whether or not you're asexual.</h3>
    <h3>Do you experience sexual attraction?</h3>
    <p>For allosexuals, sexual attraction can happen even towards strangers. It might feel like an emotional or physical desire to have sex with a specific person. When answering this question, try to think about any contexts you might have felt that attraction in. Was it towards a real person? Was it towards someone you're already close with, perhaps even partnered with? Is it frequent? Do you only experience it very occasionally?</p>

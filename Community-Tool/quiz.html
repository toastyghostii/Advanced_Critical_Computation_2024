    <p>Sexuality can be fluid, and it can change. Many people on the asexual spectrum often find themselves re-questioning themselves throughout their lives. Figuring out your sexuality can be a complicated and long process, and as you grow older, you might find out more about yourself that impacts it. Even within the asexual spectrum, there are many different labels. You don't have to identify with one, but it can be helpful to learn more about them to understand yourself better and see what you do and don't relate to. You can find a list of definitions of sexualities <a href="definitions.html">here</a> and more resources for understanding yourself and asexuality <a href="resources.html">here</a>.</p>
